      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>I am Folarin Bolaji Samuel, a creative mind from Nigeria with a growing passion for web development, cultural storytelling and digital expression.</p><br>
      <p>Though I started with HTML, I see the web as a powerful tool; not just for design or code, but for preserving identity, amplifying voices and solving real-life problems.</p><br>
      <p>I'm a student currently studying Microbiology, I'm a writer and Author to be, and an explorer of space between tradition and technology. I believe in curiosity, courage and consistency.</p><br>
